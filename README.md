# SociaLock

This is a full-stack password manager application. It is being created as a means of learning React, the full-stack development process and so that I can store my passwords somewhere (since I have too many).

The front end is JS, React, HTML, CSS, and MaterialUI.

Backend is maintained by Google's Firebase.

Hosting will be determined sometime later when I actually finish this project.
